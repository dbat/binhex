batch file bh_build2.bat to compile with different asm,
run with argument:

    1 (or none): tasm (original source)
    2: nasm
    3: uasm
    4: jwasm
    5: lzasm

uasm is jwasm sucessor -- the asm source code are identical, use uasm instead.
Only 1 commented line different with original tasm source.

nasm source need quite modification a bit, most annoyingly is it has to
be manually written/calculated stack frame on enter/exit procedure.

Although need some modification from original source to IDEAL mode,
lzasm can be considered as the true TASM successor, ONLY OMF obj produced
by lzasm can be used/linked in directly in Delphi with {$L objectfile.obj}

The other assembler failed to produce 32-bit OMF obj compatible with
Borland's TASM.

Unfortunately. lzasm development apparently was stopped in 2007 and
virtualy no documentation exists. Still, it claimed to be able to
produce SSE3 code (I haven't tested to which extent yet).
